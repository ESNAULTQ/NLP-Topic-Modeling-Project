# NLP-Topic-Modeling-Project
This repository is dedicated to the Topic Modeling project for Team 3 in our NLP-focused data science agency. The project aims to develop a robust topic modeling solution using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Our team, consisting of Mohamed, Quentin, and Rayan, will work together to explore, develop, and deploy a model capable of uncovering latent topics within large text corpora.

The project involves multiple stages, including data analysis, model development, API deployment on Azure, and the implementation of a CI/CD pipeline. The final deliverables will include a trained model, a fully functional API, a user interface, and comprehensive documentation.
